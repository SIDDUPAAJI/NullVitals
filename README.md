Null Vitals is a 2D horror adventure game developed as part of an academic project, aimed at 

delivering an immersive and strategically challenging survival experience. The game situates 

players in a dystopian, abandoned research facility devastated by a mysterious viral outbreak, 

where they must navigate through dimly lit corridors, confront hostile zombie creatures of 

varying types and behaviors, and solve environmental puzzles to progress. The player controls 

an unnamed protagonist whose objective is to uncover the dark history behind the facility’s 

downfall while striving to survive increasingly difficult encounters. The narrative unfolds 

progressively through in-game notes, audio logs, and cryptic interactions with a mysterious 

character, Dr. Cure, who guides the player with ambiguous hints, contributing to the 

psychological horror atmosphere. Developed solely using the Eclipse IDE and programmed in 

Java, the project emphasizes object-oriented design principles, ensuring modularity and 

extensibility of code through well-defined classes such as Player, Enemy with polymorphic 

behavior, Items, Interactive Objects, and Game State Manager. The game architecture is built 

around a state management system that smoothly transitions between various game states 

including title screen, gameplay, cutscenes, pause, and ending, allowing for clean separation of 

concerns and easier debugging. Key gameplay mechanics include a health system visualized 

by hearts, healing statues strategically placed for health regeneration, and an inventory system 

enabling the player to collect and utilize key items, weapons, and healing objects. A unique 

torch mechanic affects both player visibility and enemy behavior, introducing tactical decision 

making regarding light usage during exploration and combat. The save and load system is 

implemented using file serialization to persist player progress, including item collection, puzzle 

states, and unlocked areas, allowing for session continuity. Combat emphasizes strategy rather 

than brute force, requiring players to manage limited resources and select appropriate weapons 

or healing methods at critical moments. The final confrontation with a powerful boss character 

represents a culmination of gameplay mechanics and narrative tension, encouraging players to 

apply accumulated knowledge and strategic skills. Throughout development, rigorous attention 

was given to code clarity, maintainability, and efficient resource management within the 

constraints of the Eclipse IDE, demonstrating the effective application of software engineering 

practices in game development. The project integrates suspenseful storytelling, challenging 

puzzles, and emergent gameplay to create an engaging experience that reflects not only 

technical skill but also creative design sensibility. By combining methodical programming 

practices with atmospheric game design, Null Vitals stands as a comprehensive academic 

exercise in developing a coherent, functional, integration of theoretical knowledge from 

software development, game design, and object-oriented programming disciplines.
